### Step 3: Have fun!

## Advanced: How To use Matugen on this project?
This TUI reads ~/matugen-colors.txt and uses these four Color:
```
primary #ffffff
source_color #4285f4
on_error_container #ffdad6
outline #919191
```
so you can use matugen or any software to change color to anything you want (wallpaper, artwork, anything!)

> [!WARNING]
> it's based on my system, it may cause bugs / mess up your nice Rice due to incorrect paths. Be Careful With ALL Step! Please Read and Verify All commands Before Run!

First, Move to Matugen templates folder (in my system, it's on ~/.config/matugen/templates )
```bash
cd ~/.config/matugen/templates
```

Next, Copy Template File from Repo
For Example:
```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dot-1245/go-music-tui/main/colors.txt
```
(make sure you're on templates folder)

Next, Edit matugen config files (in my system, it's on ~/.config/matugen/config.toml)
```bash
cd ..
cat << 'EOF' >> ~/.config/matugen/config.toml

[templates.colors_cache]
input_path = '~/.config/matugen/templates/colors.txt'
output_path = '~/matugen-colors.txt'
EOF
```

Done! Enjoy!
